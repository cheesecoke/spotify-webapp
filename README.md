# Call outs

There is a script I used to create pages after deciding on a page structure. You can try out the script using this command:

```
node scripts/createPage.cjs
```

It has some casing issues in the App.tsx, but got the job done for creating pages quickly. It will create a directory with the name you choose. It will have options for layouts, which can be seen in storybook.

1. Responsive design was considered but there is still a lot of work.
2. Styles were copied from figma, which is not 1:1 - adjusted card size, fonts, some margin and padding.
3. Not all comments are my normal development practice, most would be a conversation or a ticket.
4. I direct a lot of links to PlayPage because of time. The podcast or show page is one I was able to spend more time getting closer to comps.
5. Chose to add navigation to all library pages.

Thank you, and enjoy!
